Premchand has always attacked on the exact causes of our. poverty exact causes of our illiteracy exact causes of of unawareness. regarding all the grim realities and grim difficulties that our society face. these days. Particularly one must remember that Premchand was writing  Premchand wrote all his novels and short stories in the. pre-Independence era when India was not free and it was under the clutches of. British monarchy. All type of oppression were being carried on in the name. of British Queen after a pro proclamation of eighteen fifty-eight. So Premchand being a artist was always awake. to see what our society is. What are its chief defects. And he always used the literary art to work as a st. as an a stimulus to awaken the people from their deep slumber and. subconscious state to see the gruelling aspect of society,"Premchand consistently criticized the root causes of poverty, illiteracy, and the general lack of awareness about the grim realities and hardships that society continues to face. It is especially important to remember that Premchand wrote all his works during the pre-Independence era, when India was still under British rule. After the Proclamation of 1858, various forms of oppression were carried out in the name of the British Crown. As an artist, Premchand remained fully conscious of the condition of society and its core defects. He used literature as a stimulus to rouse people from their deep slumber, from their subconscious inattention, and to make them see the harsh, often brutal realities of the society they lived in.",,,,144,117,573,513

Actually in the class you know I make free use of. cassettes for my kids. So we show them one. But this was for the first time otherwise that shooting. job my husband used to do for me or Ganesh but sometimes I. felt I should learn atleast samething of it. I cannot handle the camera so video camera so confidently. but I am comparatively good at outdoors. Indoors and closeups I had to take help of my husband and Ganesh.

For Premchand makes fine or rather far fetched use of. miseries and phrases. Phrases to communicate great ideas. Very direct ideas for example in a beautiful short story. dealing with the. tragic aspects of the li lives of a father and his son. Premchand shows how the daughter-in-law of a man is dying. How due to her pregnancy. And both son and father father-in-law both are so lazy. that they have just didn't care. They didn't care to their daughter-in-law and she is. dying. And which Premchand has shown in this way that while. the daughter-in-law is just on her on her death-bed crying up. mercilesly. And at the same time son and father-in-law are sleeping in deep. slumber as if two are sleeping. So there the tongue two do indicates such. a kind of pictorial touch and there lies the brilliance of use of. language in its pictorial manifestation. I think something like that.,,,,0.9321232,155,1,573,513
m now now see Chakraborti it is the proverb goes. like that that m too many cooks spoil the broth. this is a proverb and I think that in the present. situation this proverb can go well. But still m though I don't stick to this kind of. proverb because yes I do agree with you. Sometimes m the people sorry people of India. they are they belong to different communities and they have. their separate cultures. Naturally every nation has as India has a particular culture. Japan has a particular culture British has a particular culture America. has got a American people have got their own culture. So there is there is a cultural dissimilarity. Yeah yes a separate culture means within the country. not so vast the variations the variety. I'm talking about the variety. Variety in Indian culture is something something which you. don't find in the western countries. particularly in European.,,,,0.9494071,155,1,573,513
During that time also there was also supression. of woman because of the that that is the invasion of Moghals in. India and that was mainly on in north India because they invaded. south Afghanistan and because that impact was on north. India mainly. That was not in south India. So there was so many other societies which were women apart. from other field. No doubt there are some impact on all religions on caste and on. this religion. They were started the system. m not giving exhibition to the women and during that in the home only. not giving outside them permission to go outside. That was the same thing in Medieval period. And when there was started Modern Indian History and then new ideas. came from West. Therefore some impact in the thinking of our individual that who. were taken the modern Indian education that is not English education. And because of there was something strange in nineteen century. And that was concentrated in our syllabus only.,,,,0.9506774,169,1,573,513
I as I think that the people of India are not. very used to this this kind of situation because in the in the past. they had not this kind of I mean the long past. Only only one party ruled the our country. one party. But now it is the something different. It is different means because that is why I I say that. because of we are not used to that because we are traditionally. and we think that only if there is only one party then this our country will progress and if so many parties come. together there is a ideological differences. So naturally there will be clash and m our democracy. would wouldn't be able to survive. This is the this is the fear this is the fear. I I'm not very much m I'm not very much. sure whether this government is going to survive. m. But let us see that is.,,,,0.9536098,158,1,573,513
So so you have come to the same point again that India is. a country in which peoples of different cultures people of divergent states are living together should live together in the. years to come atleast in the thousand years to come for the interest. of all. So how can you expect that one particular political party say. Congress-I should rule or can rule such a big country with vast. number of pa pa I mean with a vast population belonging. to different cultural entities. How can you think. I can't make out this thing. How can you think a political party like Congress-I should rule. for our country because he is a single cook and you don't. allow other cooks to work together. I think if all the cooks are invited and the taste will be. miscellaneous divergent and as the pople in India are of divergent. qualities divergent traits and characters these dishes which will. be prepared by different cooks will be palatable to all. So you must you too at if I accept your. then also we can arrive at a conclusion that we should have different. cooks in New Delhi. What's your opinion.,,,,0.91701996,198,1,573,513
